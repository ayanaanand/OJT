def detect_cancer(image_path):
    # Implement your skin cancer detection logic here
    # This function should take the image_path as input and return the classification result
    # You can use machine learning or deep learning models to classify skin cancer
    # For the sake of this example, let's assume a simple logic to demonstrate
    
    # Placeholder logic (replace with your actual detection code)
    return "Malignant"  # Placeholder result
